<!-- FUTURE FEATURES -->

## 🔭 Future Features <a name="future-features"></a>

- [ ] **Book Recommendation System**:
Implement a book recommendation system that suggests books to students based on their interests, past borrowings, and reading history. This feature can utilize machine learning algorithms or simple recommendation rules to provide personalized book recommendations to students. The recommendation system could also take into account the popularity of books among other students or teachers to suggest trending and popular reads.

- [ ] **Book Availability Notifications**:
Introduce a notification system that alerts students and teachers when a book they are interested in becomes available in the library. This feature will help users keep track of books they want to borrow and ensure they don't miss the opportunity to borrow a book they've been waiting for. The notifications could be sent via email or through an in-app notification system.
